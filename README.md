### Developers üéì
This project was developed by a group of Boston University College of Engineering students: **Vugar Amirov** (Computer Engineering (B.S.)), **Lorraine Graham** (Electrical Engineering (B.S.)), **Mahnoor Ghani** (Computer Engineering (B.S.)), and **Ayin Pitman** (Computer Engineering (B.S.))

### Project Description üìå

This project is designed to change morse code input to a text which will be displayed on the **7 segment display**. There are **2 input buttons**. One of the buttons is used to **reset** the text which appears on the display. The other button is used as an input for either a **dot, dash, ending of a letter or a space** depending on how many **clock cycles** the button is hold. There are also **3 switches** which can be **toggled** to **switch the speed of the clock cycle** which can be observed on an **LEDs which turn on/off** during the clock cycles. There are also **LEDs** to show which of the **7 segment display** is **currently being used** so that the user would be aware what was entered.

### How to run the project üíª

- To run the project, please make sure **all files** are in the **same project directory** and then **push the bitstream** to **nexys 7 FPGA**.
- The user can **input** their desired **letter by pressing the input button at pin N17** which will decode it as either dot, dash, ending of a letter or space. There is an **LED at pin K15 and H17 which blinks every clock cycle** so that the user will be aware for how long the button should be pressed for a **dot, dash, ending of a letter, or space.** There are **3 switches** at **pin V10, U11 and U12** that can be used to **change Unit time.** The **LEDs at pin V11, V12, V14, V15, T16, U14, T15 and V16 display** which **7 segment display** is **being used.**
  - **V10 Switch - 0.25 second cycle**
  - **U11 Switch - 0.5 second cycle**
  - **U12 Switch - 1 second cycle**
  - **Default (Without any switches) - 2 second cycle**
  - **Dot - 1 clock cycles when button is active**
  - **Dash - 3 clock cycles when button is active**
  - **Space - 7 clock cycles when button is inactive**
  - **Ending of a letter - 3 clock cycles when button is inactive**
- The user can also **reset their input by pressing the input button at pin P17.**
- **After completing the sequence** for the desired letter and **letting the clock run long enough**, the **letter should be displayed on the screen.**

### Overview of what the module does ‚öôÔ∏è

- **Clock Divider:**
  - Clock Divider **takes the high-frequency clock signal** from the FPGA and **slows it down** to a manageable speed for processing. The FPGA we are using has the **frequency of 100MHz** and we **reduced** it to **2Hz** to have a **clock cycle of 0.5s** but is also **changeable using switching** allowing you to train in **4 different speeds between 0.25s to 2s.**
- **Debounder:**
  - The Debouncer module **cleans up any noise** from the **button input** to ensure **stable signals are sent** to the next stage.
- **Button to Morse:**
  - The button_to_morse module **converts** the **button press durations** into **Morse code symbols.** **Short presses** which equal to **1 clock cycle, represent dots,** while longer presses which equal to **3 clock cycles represent dashes.** This module also **detects when a letter is completed** (letter_done) or when **there‚Äôs a space** (is_space). The morse_index **signal tracks the position** of each **Morse code symbol within a letter.** You can also **reset the display** using the **reset button** (ButtonD).
- **Morse Decoder:**
  - The morse_decoder **takes the Morse code symbols** (morse_one to morse_five) and **converts** them into **their corresponding ASCII character.** It uses a **binary tree traversal logic** to **match** the sequence of **dots and dashes to letters, numbers, or special characters.** When a **valid character is decoded,** it is **sent** to the **next stage.**
- **7 Segment Display:**
  - The seven_seg_disp module **takes the ASCII character output** from the decoder and **translates** it into a **pattern for a seven-segment display.** It **cycles through multiple displays** to **show characters sequentially,** supporting up to **eight characters** at a time. The module **shifts the active display** with each **new character or reset signal.**

This is how the 7 Segment Display will show each of the letters and numbers on the display:
