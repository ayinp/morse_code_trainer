# EC 311 Final Project

## Project Name: Morse Code Trainer

---

### Developers üéì
This project was developed by a group of Boston University College of Engineering students: **Vugar Amirov** (Computer Engineering (B.S.)), **Lorraine Graham** (Electrical Engineering (B.S.)), **Mahnoor Ghani** (Computer Engineering (B.S.)), and **Ayin Pitman** (Computer Engineering (B.S.))

### Project Description üìå

This project is designed to change morse code input to a text which will be displayed on the **7 segment display**. There are **2 input buttons**. One of the buttons is used to **reset** the text which appears on the display. The other button is used as an input for either a **dot, dash, ending of a letter or a space** depending on how many **clock cycles** the button is hold. There are also **3 switches** which can be **toggled** to **switch the speed of the clock cycle** which can be observed on an **LEDs which turn on/off** during the clock cycles. There are also **LEDs** to show which of the **7 segment display** is **currently being used** so that the user would be aware what was entered.

### How to run the project üíª

- To run the project, please make sure **all files** are in the **same project directory** and then **push the bitstream** to **nexys 7 FPGA**.
- The user can **input** their desired **letter by pressing the input button at pin N17** which will decode it as either dot, dash, ending of a letter or space. There is an **LED at pin K15 and H17 which blinks every clock cycle** so that the user will be aware for how long the button should be pressed for a **dot, dash, ending of a letter, or space.** There are **3 switches** at **pin V10, U11 and U12** that can be used to **change Unit time.** The **LEDs at pin V11, V12, V14, V15, T16, U14, T15 and V16 display** which **7 segment display** is **being used.**
  - **V10 Switch - 0.25 second cycle**
  - **U11 Switch - 0.5 second cycle**
  - **U12 Switch - 1 second cycle**
  - **Default (Without any switches) - 2 second cycle**
  - **Dot - 1 clock cycles when button is active**
  - **Dash - 3 clock cycles when button is active**
  - **Space - 7 clock cycles when button is inactive**
  - **Ending of a letter - 3 clock cycles when button is inactive**
- The user can also **reset their input by pressing the input button at pin P17.**
- **After completing the sequence** for the desired letter and **letting the clock run long enough**, the **letter should be displayed on the screen.**
